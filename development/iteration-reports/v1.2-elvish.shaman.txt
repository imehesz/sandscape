Elvish Shaman, v1.2
===================

Focus
-----
Better game mechanics and new base features. Try to improve game server 
stability and game interface to allow better customizations and updates.

Difficulties
------------

Nothing to report. Coding went as expected though we could really use some more
developers.

Achievements
------------

Previous placeholder views were implemented, the game was made more stable and 
new features were introduced to provide better game experience.

The game interface was recreated and it seems to be an improvement over the 
previous interface. Still, the performance is very low and the game asks too 
much of the user's computer/browser for the game to be enjoyable.


Next
----

Improve features added in previous milestone and focus on correcting bugs. 
Create an official release after this milestone.
