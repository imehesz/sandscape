Sandscape README
================

Sandscape is a browser-based implementation of a CCG. 

This is created using asciidoc syntax and can be converted to any supported format.

Repository Struture
-------------------

The Git repository is divided in three simple folders: 

[horizontal]
dev:: Stores any development related file, from design docs, diagrams, UI sketches and spike solutions.
sandscape:: Contains the PHP base system that powers Sandscape.
www:: Contains any public resources like imagens, CSS files and every JavaScript file needed to run Sandscape.

There is no other file in the root directory, either than this README file you are seeing.
