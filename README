SandScape README
================

Intro
-----

*Sandscape* is a browser-based implementation of a CCG being developed as part 
of the *Wtactics* project (http://wtactics.org). It offers the player the 
basic tools for creating a CCG game, without forcing any rules on the actual 
game being played.

Along side the basic playing field, *SandScape* has the usual user management
system, which requires valid authentication in order to play, a lobby system
where players can see each other and arrange games and simple statistics
recording.

No artificial intelligence was implemented in the platform.

Installation
------------

Installing *Sandscape* is a step only users interested in having their own server
instance should take. You *don't* need to have *Sandscape* installed in order 
to play, the software is installed in a server and accessed using a browser.

.Steps
1. Please make sure you have Apache Web Server, PHP and MySQL installed.

2. Place the contents of the folder *www* in a public accessible place, normally 
this is a folder named *htdocs*, *www* or *public_html*.

3. Place the *sandscape* and *yii* folders outside the public accessible folder.
These two folder contain the application's main files, configurations and many
private informations, it is a security risk to have these files in a place
where every browser can access.

4. Change settings in the _sandscape/config/main.php_ and 
_sandscape/config/params.php_.

5. Create the database using the provided _database.sql_ file and insert a new 
user, manually, in the database and make sure that user is an administrator. 
Remember that the password is an SHA1 hash created by appending the hash 
sentence from _params.php_ to the password.
