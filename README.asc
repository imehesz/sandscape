Sandscape
=========

Sandscape is a browser-based implementation of a CCG being developed as part 
of the [Wtactics project](http://wtactics.org). It offers the player the 
basic tools for creating a CCG game, without forcing any rules on the actual 
game being played.

Along side the basic playing field, SandScape has the usual user management
system, which requires valid authentication in order to play, a lobby system
where players can see each other and arrange games and simple statistics
recording.

No artificial intelligence was implemented in the platform nor are there any 
plans to implement game rules.

Process
~~~~~~~

Installing Sandscape is a step only users interested in having their own server
instance should take. You *don't* need to have Sandscape installed in order 
to play, the software is installed in a server and accessed using a browser.

.Steps

1. Please make sure you have Apache Web Server, PHP and MySQL installed.
2. Place the contents of the folder *www* in a public accessible place, normally 
this is a folder named *htdocs*, *www* or *public_html*.
3. Place the *sandscape* and *framework* folders outside the public accessible folder.
These two folder contain the application's main files, configurations and many
private informations, it is a security risk to have these files in a place
where every browser can access.
4. Copy the example settings files available in _development/example-configs_ to 
_sandscape/config_. You should have three files, _main.php_, _params.php_ and 
_console.php_. Copy the example _htaccess.example_ file to the _www_ folder and name 
it _.htaccess_, please note the initial dot in the file name, it is important.
5. Create the database using the provided SQL files and insert a new 
user, manually, in the database and make sure that user is an administrator. 
Remember that the password is an SHA1 hash created by appending the hash 
sentence from _params.php_ to the password.
