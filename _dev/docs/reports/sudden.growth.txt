Sudden Growth, v1.0
===================

Focus
-----

Restart project development and assure a steady/continuous, or at least predictable, 
development pace. Bring all code up-to-date and remove any reference to StaySimple CMS. 
The current code is a complete mess with mixed Yii usage and some tests with StaySimple CMS. 
These should have been made in a new branch but I was dumb enough to ignore that 
and made complete mess with the code.

The main objective has shifted to create a usable system in the shortest amount of 
time possible and most of the commits for this iteration will be made of general 
code updates, moving files, and other actions that will break any semblance of 
stable system, it won't be possible for other developers or interested users to 
keep track of changes and to test the system and it's features. I'm hopping I can 
solve this mess in a 2 or 3 day sprint.

Difficulties
------------

Developing in PHP all day and coming to a project that uses, yet again, this technology 
at the end of the day has taken a toll on the development progress. The all project 
went on hiatus almost for 5 moths and is way behind schedule. Currently the main 
difficulties are related to messed up code with mixed platforms.

Most of the existing features have either been re-implemented or have been removed 
and several bugs were introduced that we don't have time to solve. The biggest 
problem was the forced pace that I imposed on the development, that fast pace 
development resulted in several crippled features that need to be corrected with 
time as soon as users start given back feedback.

Also, giving the confusion I was in, tasks have been made with little regard to 
how the were planed (implementing features from other iterations, adding new features 
and removing planned ones).

Restarting the all development was hard, both on the code sanity and my own :)

Achievements
------------

Although there were several problems I still managed to develop the all main system 
in the few 4 or 5 days that I've been working for, and the current version 1.0 can 
be considered a usable enough version to guarantee that users can use and test the 
application.

While code was being developed, most of the supporting tools were updated, the 
SourceForge page has better descriptions with more information, the Trac system 
is working and most ideas have been moved to it and the wiki is being updated on 
a more steady page. Also there is already a new sub forum 
footnote:[http://chaosrealm.net/wtactics/forum/viewforum.php?f=14] in WTactics 
forum that can be used.

I consider this iteration to be a complete failure because it was late, out of 
control and did not produce quality code, although it produced much code.

Next
----

The next iteration will have to keep the goal of a usable system in a short amount 
of time while bringing the development speed down and restoring proper control to 
the development process.
