Soulharvester, v1.3
===================

Focus
-----

Improve features added in previous milestone and focus on correcting bugs. 
Create an official release after this milestone.

Difficulties
------------

We lost speed again. Being the only developer makes the all project too dependent 
on my own availability and this is causing slow downs and other problems in the 
project.

I'm starting to be hit by some of the sloppy programming and fast coding that 
was done in the first version. Though the code is somewhat stable and usable, 
and it did help the project get some traction, the fact that many bugs were 
introduced and that I now have to change many already implemented features makes 
the project go even slower and the repository contains some bugs that prevent 
new developers and testers to join.

Some issues were found that date to the first version, this has made clear that 
the development process needs to include better testing procedures and a we 
could use a public, always available, testing server.

Achievements
------------

Many new features were added, mainly to the supporting areas of Sandscape like 
user management, profile management, global chat, etc. Still I made a real mess 
of the code and broke many previously correct features. The next milestone needs 
to really focus on stability.

Next
----

Stability, stability and more stability! We need to make sure the next milestone 
ends with a usable, stable and feature complete project that can be used by 
players. Even if not all the features that users want are there we need to make 
sure the current listed features are properly implemented and tested. 

Promotion should also be a priority. We need more developers, at least one or two 
more, that can keep the project going when I'm busy.
