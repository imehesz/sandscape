Install
-------

Being a web based platform developed in PHP, *Sandscape* requires a webserver 
capable of running the PHP engine (version 5.2+) and a MySQL database server 
(version 5.0+). 

In order for users to be able to play games in *Sandscape*, the server needs to 
be publicly accessible.

Installing Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Copy the folders _yii_ and _sandscape_ to your server, make sure the folders 
are one level above your server's public folder. *Do not* copy the contents, 
copy the two folders.

2. Copy the *contents* of the _www_ folder to your server's public folder.

3. Make sure that the webserver's user is able to write in the _assets_ folder 
inside the public server and the _sandscape/runtime_ folder.

4. Create the database using the provided _database.sql_ file.

.Note:
If you want to place the _sandscape_ and the _yii_ folders in some other place 
you'll need to update the paths in the _index.php_ file that is inside the 
server's public folder.

Changing Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two configuration files that need to be changed: _main.php_ and 
_params.php_.

In the _main.php_ you need to change the connection string to include the host 
address and the database name and the username and password.

Replace the texts: *<HOST ADDRESS>* with the address for your database server, 
usually *localhost*; *<DATABASE NAME>* with the database name; *<DATABASE USER>* 
with the user that has permissions on the database; *<DATABASE PASSWORD>* with 
the password for the database user.

In the _params.php_ file you need to change the *hash* value. Replace the demo 
sentence with a random sentence. This sentence will be used try to increase the 
uniqueness of every user's password.

Initial User
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since there is no installation wizard at the moment, the first user needs to be 
created manually using the hash that was placed in the _params.php_ file. You'll 
need a way to generate an SHA1 hash (e.g.: http://www.sha1.cz/, or search for 
online SHA1 generators). Append the hash sentence to the desired password and 
copy the generated string, make sure you copy only the 40 characters that 
comprise the generated string.

Insert a new user in the database and provide the generated string.

.Example SQL:
----
INSERT INTO `User` (`email`, `password`, `name`, `admin`)
VALUES ('REPLACE WITH YOUR E-MAIL', 'PLACE THE STRING HERE', 'Administrator', 1) ;
----

Setting Initial Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the above steps, your *Sandscape* platform is ready to receive new users. 
The only missing setting is the system e-mail that will be used when sending 
e-mails to your users.

Access you newly installed *Sandscape* and in the general administration section 
fill in the field for the system e-mail.

You can ignore this step but the system won't send e-mails to your users.
