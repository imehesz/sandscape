Serenity, v1.5
==============

Focus
-----

Make Sandscape feature complete. Promote code stability and make sure a release 
file is created.

Difficulties
------------

Another long stop cause by other projects needing attention has made this one 
very slow iteration. Moving to another theme has helped detecting bugs and 
testing features but has also contributed to an increase in the work load.

Again I'm feeling the lack of, at least, one other developer in the project 
that keeps working when I'm not available and helps to maintain a record of 
what has been done and what is still pending. Even with _Trac_ its hard to 
remember what I was working on each time I have to stop for a longer period of 
time.

Achievements
------------

Next
----

Test, test and test. I need this thing tested as much as possible before 
starting a new development milestone.
