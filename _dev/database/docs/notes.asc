Database Implementation Notes
=============================


While creating the ER diagram for the database took into account the correct 
steps to create a relational database, not every ER diagram rule was applied 
correctly to the diagram thus some of the resulting tables are not what one 
would expect. You can think about this as an initial _denormalization_.

The following is an attempt to document those differences and to justify why 
they were created in the first place.

PlayB
-----

_PlayB_ relation between _Game_ and _User_.

[horizontal]
Correct:: A table for the relation so that no null values could be present in 
the _N_ side's data.

Implemented:: _N_ side has a foreign key to the _User_ table since each game 
has exactly 2 players but only the first one is know at the game's creating, 
leaving the second relation, _PlayB_ undecided until another player joins the 
game.

Use*
----

_UseA_ and _UseB_ relation between _Game_ and _Deck_.

[horizontal]
Correct:: A table for both relations so that no null values could be present in 
the _N_ side's data.

Implemented:: _N_ side has a foreign key to the _Deck_ table since each game 
has exactly 2 decks but the players can decide which deck to use after the game 
is created. Provides an easier way, from a programmers view, to access the deck 
since a 3rd table is not needed.

Performance penalty is considered low and the gain enough to outweigh the change.
