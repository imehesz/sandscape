<h1>About SandScape</h1>
<quote>The purpose of Sandscape project is to create a virtual online and purely browser based environment where players can meet to play a CCG. Sandscape is, as all things WT, an open source endeavor that should be generic, easy to extend and modify so that it can be of use in other projects, making it possible to play almost any CCG with it. To the best of our knowledge there is no such existing libre software around today.</quote>
<p>Here you can play WTactics with your friends online.</p>
